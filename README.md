# ClientServerMixed

**ClientServerMixed** is a program that allows you to use a server or a client using two different programming languages: Java and Python. The program enables clients to send two geographical locations to the server, which will calculate the distance between the two points and respond with the result.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following components installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ClientServerMixed.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd ClientServerMixed
```

## Usage

To use these programs I recommend using Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).


## Communication Between Client and Server

The client sends two geographical locations to the server in latitude and longitude format. The server calculates the distance between the two points using the Haversine formula and returns the result to the client.
